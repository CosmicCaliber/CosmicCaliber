Josey - "DAMN IT KADE!! GET US STABLE!!"

Kade - "What does it look like im doing?! I"M TRYING! I got one damn wing and shot rotors" 

Josey - "Watch your tone young man! I'll kick your ass back to Enron" 

Kade - "Sorry.."

Josey - "GRRR, Theyre trying to kil us! How could you let us get hit??"

Kade - It wasn't my fault! This stupid junk box has no torque, If Twill hadnt sacked a shitty cutter, I'd have real firepower. Those cops probably have good gear to loot."

Josey - "Kade stop...this is bad. we're running out of time. Set your cords to the closest waste body we can lose them there, and send a hail for any rovers looking to make some coin."
